🏗️ Project Setup
This project contains test cases for the Login feature (for example, Amazon/Flipkart) designed using three test case design techniques:
✅ Equivalence Partitioning (EP)
✅ Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
✅ Decision Table

The deliverable is provided as a document (or spreadsheet) with clearly labeled sections for each technique.

🛠️ Build Commands
There are no build or run commands for this assignment because it focuses purely on test design documentation, not executable code.

However, if you want to organize this in a repository, you can structure it like:

bash

⚙️ Brief Description of Functionalities
The document includes:

At least 3–4 test cases per technique.

Clear identification of:

Valid and invalid input conditions.

Boundary values.

Decision conditions and resulting actions.

The test cases cover the login functionality, ensuring input validation, boundary handling, and logical conditions are tested thoroughly.
